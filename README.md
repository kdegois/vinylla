A marketplace for vinyl records.

## Install

You will need to run this code on a machine with an apache server and PHP installed. The easiest way to do this is with xampp. [Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) xampp and install it on you machine.

Create an empty folder on your new server ie http://localhost/vinylla. CD to this folder using terminal/ comand prompt.

Provided you have GIT installed use the 'git clone https://github.com/kdegois/vinylla/' command to copy this repo to your local staging server. You can then PULL/ PUSH/ COMMIT etc to this repo after changing code.

I have used a remote MySQL database for the time being so we can all use this at the same time. This can be accessed with PHPMYADMIN if you so desire at [https://droplet.bry.gg/phpmyadmin], the username is 'vinylla' and the password is 'vvbo!0JPXY4AjlUo'. You're welcome to make your own local MySQL database simply change the details in dbconnect.php.
