A marketplace for vinyl records.

## Install

You will need to run this code on a machine with an apache server and PHP installed. The easiest way to do this is with xampp. [Download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) xampp and install it on you machine.

CD to the root directory of your http://localhost/ server. In XAMPP control panel there will be an option to do this. Press 'SHELL'.

Provided you have GIT installed use the 'git clone https://github.com/kdegois/vinylla/' command to clone this repo onto your local machine. You will then find the build at [http://localhost/vinylla].

I have used a remote MySQL database for the time being so we can all use this at the same time. This can be accessed with PHPMYADMIN (a simple mysql GUI) if you so desire at [https://droplet.bry.gg/phpmyadmin], the username is 'vinylla' and the password is 'vvbo!0JPXY4AjlUo'. You're welcome to make your own local MySQL database simply change the details in dbconnect.php.
